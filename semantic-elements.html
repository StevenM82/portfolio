        <h2>What to do, what to do.</h2>
        <p>While I sat here, trying to figure out what to write, both inside my code and out, I realized<br>
          something. The more that I work on this, the more I save and refresh, the more fun it is to<br>
          see how it changes. The main problem that I am having right now is that it still looks kinda<br>
          plain.
